# QvATPC - Terminal Process Controller


## Overview
QvATPC addresses a common pain point for modern developers who juggle multiple services, especially in microservices architectures. While tools like tmux and screen offer terminal multiplexing, QvATPC brings unique advantages

### Key Features
- Process-aware control rather than just terminal splitting
- Focused command routing to specific services
- Selective output visibility without window management
- Port management and monitoring
- Colored, structured output for better readability
- Simple command interface that feels natural

### Development scenarios where QvATPC shines
- Full-stack development with multiple services
- Microservices development and testing
- Frontend development with backend services : eg. Angular/React, NodeJS 
- Development environments with multiple data services : eg. Files, DataBridges
- IoT projects with multiple communication endpoints

### Unique Position In Development Experience
While tools like PM2 handle process management and tmux offers terminal multiplexing, QvATPC creates a perfect bridge between these approaches. The closest alternatives like PM2 focus on process management but lack the terminal interaction capabilities. VS Code's integrated terminal requires manual splitting and doesn't offer process-aware controls.It delivers process-aware terminal control that modern developers need.
